Renders trello boards as easily-printable webpages.

Forked from the [brilliant gist](https://gist.github.com/mathiasrw/8710615) by @mathiasrw.

### Usage

Export a board using the left panel [as per these instructions](https://help.trello.com/article/747-exporting-data-from-trello-1).
Then, drag the downloaded file into the UI away you go. You can choose to exclude
lists using the check boxes at the top. They are not included in the final output.
